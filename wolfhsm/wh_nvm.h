 *
 * Abstract library to provide management of NVM objects providing basic
 * metadata association with blocks of data.  The backend storage is expected
 * to have flash-style semantics with Read, Erase, and Program hooks.
 *
 * This library is expected to provide reliable, atomic operations (recoverable)
 * to ensure transactions are fully committed prior to returning success.
 * Initial indexing and handling of incomplete transactions are allowed to take
 * longer than ordinary runtime function calls.
 *
 * NVM objects are added with a fixed length and data.  Removal of objects
 * causes the backend to replicate the entire partition without the
 * listed objects present, which also maximizes the contiguous free space.
