 * Base WolfHSM Client Library API
 *
 * The WolfHSM Client provides a single context and connection to a
 * WolfHSM Server.  All communications and state are internally managed by
 * registering a crypto callback function to be invoked synchronously when
 * wolfCrypt functions are called.  In order to specify to use the WolfHSM
 * Server for cryptographic operations, the device id WH_DEV_ID should be
 * passed into any of the wolfCrypt init functions.
 *
 * In addition to the offload of cryptographic functions, the WolfHSM Client
 * also exposes WolfHSM Server key management, non-volatile memory, and protocol
 * functions.
