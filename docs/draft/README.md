# Draft Documentation

This directory holds documentation for individual features added to wolfHSM.

Eventually these documents should be refined and incorporated into the "V2"
wolfHSM documentation and the online manual. For now we leave them here so they
can inform code review and still be helpful so users, despite being in "draft"
state.
