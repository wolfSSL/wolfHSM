# Skeleton Port

The Skeleton port source code provides a non-functioning layout to be used as a starting point for future hardware/platform ports. Each function provides the basic description and expected flow with error cases explained so that ports can be used interchangeably with consistent results.

The Skeleton port provides implementations of:
- Transport
- NVM Device
- Flash Device
- Crypto Device
