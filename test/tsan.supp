# Category: Transport Memory Layer (Lock-free by Design)
# =============================================================================
# The shared memory transport uses a lock-free protocol with volatile pointers,
# memory fences, and cache operations. TSAN doesn't understand this higher-level
# protocol and flags the raw memory accesses as races.

# CSR (Control/Status Register) access functions
